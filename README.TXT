# Psychological Operations
This project is to determine whether or not a news article is more factual or opinionated.

To run this project:
Run the run.sh script with a single parameter indicating whether or not this is the first time running this script. This only needs to be done the first time as typing 'y' will change the executable status of all the included files using chmod +x, downloading all the dependencies using pip, and save all the training data to make the process more efficient.
